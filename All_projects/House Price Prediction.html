          <h3>Predicting House Prices: A Machine Learning Approach.</h3>
          <p>
            In this project, we will explore the use of a machine learning algorithm to predict house prices. We will utilize a dataset containing information about different houses, such as crime rates, zoning, proximity to amenities, and more. 
            By analyzing this dataset and training a regression model, we aim to create a reliable house price prediction model. </p>  
            <p> Let's dive into the analysis and discover some fascinating insights</p>  
          </p>

            <b>Data Exploration
      
              <br>
              <small>The dataset contains information on 506 houses and consists of 13 numerical features, including crime rate, number of rooms, age of the property, and others. The target variable, which we aim to predict, is the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV).</small></b>

    <b>Training and Testing Split
      <br>
      <small>The training set, which comprises 80% of the data, will be used to train our model, 
        while the testing set (20% of the data) will serve as an independent evaluation to assess the model's performance.</small></b>

    <b >Model Prediction</b>
      <br>
      <small>With our trained model, we now evaluate its performance using the testing dataset. We calculate various evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared, to assess how well the model predicts house prices. 
        A lower MSE and a higher R-squared value indicate better predictive performance.</small>
